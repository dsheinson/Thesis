	a Monte Carlo method in which successive prediction, filtering (and

	are approximated by many of their realizations. The particular contribution
	of this algorithm is that it can be applied to a broad class of nonlinear
	non-Gaussian higher dimensional state space models on the provision
	that the dimensions of the system noise and the observation noise
	are relatively low. Several numerical examples are shown.},
